### TODO

- [ ] see if [pdfcpu](https://pdfcpu.io/extract/extract) can extract videos
  - https://github.com/pdfcpu/pdfcpu/issues/235 mentions RichMedia but no other
    references in that project
- [ ] Find a pdf with videos embedded
  - or the original exercises file
  - or a way to generate a test pdf with a bunch of generated videos

- `nix-shell` or `direnv allow`
